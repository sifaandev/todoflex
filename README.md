# 📝 Task Manager App

A modern **Task Manager / Todo App** built with the **same tech stack** across the project. The app supports **Active & Completed tasks**, **Add / Delete / Clear All**, **Search**, **Dark & Light mode**, and uses **LocalStorage** to persist data.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ **Add Tasks** – Create new tasks instantly
* 🔄 **Active & Completed Tasks** – Separate task states
* ✏️ **Update Task Status** – Mark tasks as completed or active
* 🗑️ **Delete Task** – Remove individual tasks
* ❌ **Delete All Tasks** – Clear all tasks at once
* 🔍 **Search Tasks** – Quickly find tasks by name
* 🌙 **Dark / Light Mode** – Toggle between themes
* 💾 **LocalStorage Support** – Data persists even after refresh

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React (same tech used throughout)
* **Styling:** CSS / Tailwind (as used in project)
* **State Management:** React Hooks
* **Storage:** Browser LocalStorage

## 🧠 How It Works

* Tasks are stored in **LocalStorage**
* On app load, tasks are fetched from LocalStorage
* Any **add / update / delete** action updates both state & LocalStorage
* Theme preference (Dark/Light) is also stored locally
